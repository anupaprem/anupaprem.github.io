# Outcome

Elective module in "Foundations of Data Analytics"

## Course offered 
Monsoon 2022 (Starting Aug 21, 2022): EC6435D

## Learning Outcomes
1. Demonstrate ability to identify and integrate data of various types from a variety of sources, and make informed judgements about their use in data science research
2. Critically evaluate the methodologies applied in data gathering, data processing and data exploration to disseminate findings using data visualisation tools.
3. Apply different data science tools to create appropriate visualisations of high dimensionality data, aligned to the students area of interest

## Bonus
Short course certificate from Oxford Brookes University.

# Course Project (Individual)
In the course project you will identify a suitable data problem, obtain the dataset, create a database and perform data visualization on the problem. You will produce a final report, an
article, a poster or a flyer where you display the data visually to a specific audience. The evaluation would focus on the design process to achieve the final visualization. 
Evaluation sub-tasks:
1. Transforming the data obtained into an appropriate normal formal and converting into a SQL database, and defining appropriate keys, data types and relationships. 
2. Data pre-processing using python and SQL queries from Python
3. Data Transformation and Exploratory data analysis in Python
4. Conclusion and Inference about the selected data set.

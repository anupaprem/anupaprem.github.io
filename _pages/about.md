I am an Assistant Professor at the ECE Department in NIT Calicut. Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral researcher and Emirates-Oxford Data Science Fellow in the Machine learning group at the University of Oxford, during the period June 2018 - Mar 2020. I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2018 from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. I hold an M.E. in Signal Processing from Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, and a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from  College of Engineering Trivandrum (University of Kerala).

My research interests are broadly in statistical signal processing, stochastic decision making and Bayesian machine learning, with applications to sensor networks (during my Masters), social media and networks (during my Ph.D) and multi-agent systems (during my postdoc).

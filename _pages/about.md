I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Machine learning group at University of Oxford. Prior to that, I did my Ph.D. at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. 

My research interests are in statistical signal processing and machine learning with applications to social media and multi-agent systems.

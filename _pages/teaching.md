Teaching assistant for the course _Stochastic Signals and Systems_ for _4_ terms taken by the 3rd year ECE undergraduates at UBC. The course is a formal introduction to probability, statistics, information theory, Markov chain, Bayesian inference and stochastic linear system. It is also a pre-requisite for advanced courses in machine learning, control, and signal processing. Even though the course is technically challenging, the popularity of the course has only increased and reached a maximum of 120 students. 

In all the terms, I handled the main responsibility of designing the tutorials for the class. This involved a 2 hour lecture and a 1 hour Q&A session per week. In addition to tutorials, I taught over 10 hours of substitute main lecture.

Below is the summary of my teaching review:
